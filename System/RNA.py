RNA System Documentation:

The RNA system in the game serves as a mechanism for simulating genetic processes, such as protein synthesis and mutation. It operates based on a set of core functionalities encapsulated within the Source code, supplemented by additional layers provided in the Layers variable. Developers can interact with the RNA system to create dynamic and evolving gameplay experiences.

For more information on how to use the RNA system, refer to the official documentation or consult with the development team.
